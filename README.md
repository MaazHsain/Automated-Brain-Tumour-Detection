# Automated-Brain-Tumour-Detection

This repository is based on Automated Brain Tumour Detection. It contains the codes which were implemented during this project. This project was carried on Kaggle platform due to it providing the necessary tools and powerful GPUs and CPUs, which were important to run the model training efficiently. The dataset and model files are too huge to put up on github, thus, I have uploaded them on google drive. You can request access to them by contacting me through my email.
